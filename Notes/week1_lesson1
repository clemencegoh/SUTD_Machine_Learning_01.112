The few factors affecting performance:
    - Quality of training data provided
    - form and extent of any initial background knowledge
    - type of feedback provided
    - Learning algorithms used (time also a part of this)

Important factors:
    - Modelling
    - Optimization

Types of machine Learning
    !- Supervised Learning [data + labels]
        - Linear and Non-linear
        - Prediction
        - Classification(discrete labels), Regression (real values) 

    !- Unsupervised Learning [data only]
        - Clustering
        - Probability distribution estimation
        - Finding association (in features)
        - Dimension reduction (Subspace Learning) 
            - This involves visualising 3D data, so that we can better project them onto 2D space

    - Semi-supervised Learning [some data have labels, some do not]

    !- Reinforcement Learning
        - Decision making (robot, chess machine) [From AI bots such as alphaGo and alphaGo Zero]
        - Rewards from a sequence of actions

    !- Transfer Learning
        - Application of skills/concepts learnt from one to another

    - Deep Learning
