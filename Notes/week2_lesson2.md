**Clustering**
---
- Clustering comes under unsupervised learning
- Some uses:
    - Data compression
        - images (RGB, 3 vectors)
        - hashmap with 3 vectors

- Similarity Measures:
    - Key to grouping points
    - distance = inverse of similarity (??) slide 16
    - The Minkowski distance is similar to euclean distance. Objective of this is to find the shortest distance between 2 points.
    - Shortest Distance: {p}rt(Sum((x - y)^p))

- Clusters (with hierarchical methods)
    - Hierarchical dendograms (slide 35)
        - This is used to determine which points are the closest to each other based on hierarchy
