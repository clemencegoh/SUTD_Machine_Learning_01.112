# Shapley Value - Game theory

- Used in determining how much should be paid to 
each contributor for marginally contributing to the
user conversion
- Use ROC curve to select the model
    - Idea is to determine: correct => 1 step up, 
    wrong => 1 step right
    - Therefore, model with highest Area Under Curve will be
    selected
    
- Case Study:
    - Starhub: Changing cost of platform advertisements from:
    facebook => asian parents

- Usage of a decision tree to train an advertiser specific 
bidder (Determines if the user has seen the same ad more than
3 times, if it's IOS or android, etc.)

- Realm of possibility within ML: 
    - Google AdWords
